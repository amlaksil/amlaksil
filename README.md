👋 Hello, I'm Silamlak Desye

👨‍💻 I'm an enthusiastic software developer specializing in backend development. Recently, completed a comprehensive 12-month full-stack software engineering program at ALX, where I gained in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in building robust and scalable web applications.

🌟 Throughout the program, I have honed my skills in shell scripting, c, python, java-script and web application development. I also become proficient in working with both relational databases, including SQL(MySQL, SQLite), and non-relational databases like NoSQL(Redis, MongoDB). Moreover, I developed a strong understanding of database management, server-side development, and API design.

🚀 I'm eager to apply my knowledge and contribute to exciting projects that push the boundaries of technology. I'm quick learner, problem-solver, and enjoy collaborating with others to build innovative solutions.

🌱 Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to kick-start my professional journey as a backend developer. I'm open to both full-time positions and internships that will allow me to continue learning and growing in a supportive environment.
